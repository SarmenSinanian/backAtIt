# Consider P1(A,B) and P2(A,B) to be two points on a 2D plane.
#
# A happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
# B happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
# C happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
# D happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
# Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
